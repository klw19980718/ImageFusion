        "excerpt": "Learn how to shoot photos best suited for conversion to Polaroid style, including lighting, angles, and composition tips.",
        "content": "<h2>Master the Light</h2><p>Natural light is the soul of Polaroid-style photos. Try to shoot during the day in soft light, avoiding direct sunlight which can cause overexposure or harsh shadows. Diffused light from a window often works great.</p><h2>Choose Angles and Composition</h2><p>Experiment with different angles. Classic front-facing portraits work well, but a slight tilt or a low-angle shot can add interest. Pay attention to the subject's placement in the frame, perhaps using the 'rule of thirds'. To mimic the instant feel, don't strive for perfect symmetry; a candid feel is better.</p><h2>Highlight the Subject</h2><p>Ensure the subject is sharp. Use portrait mode (if available) for a slightly blurred background, or choose a simple background to avoid clutter. Our AI performs best with clear, well-defined subjects.</p><h2>Color and Emotion</h2><p>Vibrant photos with moderate contrast usually yield more appealing conversions. Consider the emotion conveyed; happy, warm moments align well with the nostalgic feel of Polaroids.</p><p>Follow these simple tips, combine them with our AI tool, and you'll easily create charming retro Polaroid-style 3D cartoon photos!</p>"

It now better understands depth information in photos, generating 3D cartoon effects with a more pronounced sense of dimension. Facial contours, hair details, and the layering of foreground and background elements are significantly improved.</p><h2>Optimized Lighting and Shading</h2><p>The new algorithm also optimizes lighting and shading logic, simulating more natural light effects consistent with cartoon styles. Transitions between highlights and shadows are smoother, creating a more harmonious overall image.</p><h2>How to Experience It?</h2><p>No extra steps needed! Starting now, all photos generated via PolaToons will automatically use the enhanced 3D effect. Go ahead, upload your favorite photos, and experience the refreshed visuals!</p><p>We are committed to continuously improving our AI models to bring you more surprises. Stay tuned for future updates!</p>"
