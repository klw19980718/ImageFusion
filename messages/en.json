        "content": "<h2>Master the Lighting</h2><p>Natural light is key to great photos for fusion. Try to shoot in soft, diffused daylight, avoiding harsh direct sunlight that can cause overexposure or hard shadows. The scattered light near windows typically works wonderfully.</p><h2>Choose Your Angles and Composition</h2><p>Experiment with different shooting angles. While classic frontal portraits work well, slight tilts or low-angle shots can add interest. Pay attention to subject placement, utilizing the \"rule of thirds\". For the best fusion results, capture natural moments rather than perfectly posed shots.</p><h2>Emphasize Your Subject</h2><p>Ensure your subject is well-defined. Use portrait mode (if your phone supports it) for a slightly blurred background, or choose simple backgrounds to avoid clutter. Our AI performs best when processing photos with clear, well-defined subjects.</p><h2>Colors and Emotions</h2><p>Vibrant colors and moderate contrast typically yield more appealing results after fusion. Consider the emotions your photo conveys - joyful, warm moments work excellently with our artistic fusion algorithms.</p><p>Follow these simple tips with our AI tools, and you'll easily create stunning artistic images with unique visual appeal!</p>"
